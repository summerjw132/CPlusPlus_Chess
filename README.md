# CPlusPlus_Chess
A console/command line-based ASCII Chess Game built with the purpose of exploring C++ (as well as building a chess game...obviously!)

# Gameplay:
The game runs in phases from the moment it runs until the moment the game ends.
* Currently, the game is a 2 player, PvP only game
* Players take turns moving chess pieces according to each piece's movement pattern until one of the players' king is either taken/captured/unable to move without being captured (aka Checkmate/Win Scenario), or escapes capture for a certain amount of turns after losing a certain amount of supporting pieces (aka Draw Scenario)
